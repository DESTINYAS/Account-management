Account MANAGEMENT APPLICATION.

Welcome to my  account management application! This system is designed basically to do the following :
(1) Open a unique ten digit account number for a user. The user is only required to provide his details and account type. The system authomatically generates a unique 10 digit account number and save all the information in a mongodb then synchronizes it to postgresdb ie also saves it in a postgresdb. There is also endpoint to get all accounts and get accounts by id.
